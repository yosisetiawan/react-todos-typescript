# React Simple Todo Apps

The project is called Simple Todos App, built using React JS with Vite and TypeScript. I decided to create this app to relearning React JS and explore TypeScript as a programming language, as my previous project was developed using JavaScript. 

Throughout this project, I plan to make incremental updates to continuously improve it. Additionally, I intend to embark on new projects in the future using React JS and TypeScript.
